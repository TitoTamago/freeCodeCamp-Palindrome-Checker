# freeCodeCamp-Palindrome-Checker
A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.  Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
